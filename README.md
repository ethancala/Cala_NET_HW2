/*The application
you'll create will calculate the values of polynomial functions of up to degree 3 over a domain. It
will start with a heading. It will then ask you to enter the details of a polynomial, including its degree, its
coefficients, and the min and max of the dom
ain. Provided all the data was entered correctly, the application will
tabulate the values over the domain. It will then ask the user if they want to enter the details for another
polynomial. If they do, it will repeat the process*/
